  CHANGES:

  0.60 (2012-07-04):
  Treats arguments as patterns rather than files to ease processing of 
  multiple files in multiple subdirectories.  Added -s (start directory)
  and -m (max depth) options. 

  0.52 (2012-06-05): Upgraded for python 3. Still compatible with python 2.7.

  0.51 (2012-05): Initial release (Beta).
