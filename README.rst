Implements a python mass editor class to process multiple files at once.

I have been using runsed and checksed (from Unix Power Tools) for years and
did not find a good substitute under Windows until I came accross Graham 
Fawcett python recipe on :
http://code.activestate.com/recipes/437932-pyline-a-grep-like-sed-like-command-line-tool/

The core was fleshed up a little, and here we are. If you find it usefull and
enhance it please, do not forget to submit patches. Thanks!
